                            <p>
                                I am a recent graduate from Asia Pacific University, Malaysia. I studied Computer Science and graduated with a Bachelor of Science (Hons) in Computer Science.

                                My technical interests lie in backend engineering, and machine learning. But I also have experience in frontend engineering with React and Angular. Iâ€™ve worked at various startups over the years and now I look to increase my skillsets by working on larger scale systems.
                                <br />
                                I'm interested in solving deep technical problems. In my previous part-time and internship experiences I have solved a wide array of technical problems. If I have to share such an experience, for one of the products I worked on I designed an algorithm to fulfill customer orders with the nearest cheapest supplier, for which I drew inspiration from travelling salesman problem. I would like to continue solving such problems as part of your company where I believe engineers solve large scale problems every day
